# CodSoft Tasks

Welcome to the CodSoft Tasks repository! This document outlines the tasks you need to complete for your machine learning internship. Each task focuses on a different aspect of machine learning and will help you develop practical skills in this field.

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Task 3: Spam SMS Detection

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
